/**
 * SKRAPA Types - managed by skrapa.
 *
 * Every skrapa command checks this file and rewrites it only when it differs
 * from the version bundled with your installed skrapa, so edits here are
 * overwritten on the next run. Do NOT add your own global types here; put
 * project globals in a separate `.d.ts` file instead.
 *
 * Types live under the `Skrapa` namespace so nothing shipped here can collide
 * with a type of your own. The four names outside it are the ones the compiler
 * and the runtime must find globally, by exactly these names: `jsx` and
 * `Fragment` are the JSX factory pair named in tsconfig.json and are called by
 * the emitted code, `JSX` is where TypeScript looks up intrinsic elements, and
 * `VERSION` is injected as a global at build time. Moving any of them into the
 * namespace makes every `<div>` fail to compile.
